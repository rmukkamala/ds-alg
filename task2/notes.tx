LRU:
Used hash data structure (dictionary) for accessing the key.
Used queue for tracking/insertion/deletion. 
Implemented the queue using doubly linked lists.
Time Complexity: The above data structures help us in achieving O(1) time complexity.

get Method:
# Retrieve item from provided key. Return -1 if nonexistent.
set Method:
# Set the value if the key is not present in the cache. If the cache is at capacity remove the oldest item.


File Recursion:
The find_files function will return for every file in a folders recursively with given input pattern(extension)
Used recursion to find the relevant files in the sub folders as well.
Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of files and m is the number of directories.(It will mostly lead to O(n) in most cases since n will be bigger than m)


Huffman Coding:
Ideally, we use min-heaps to implement this. But since, we did not cover them in this module. I went with a different approach.
Used tuples and lists to implement binary trees as data structure. 

Helper functions used for encoding and decoding:
def frequency: get frequency of the chars in a dictionary for the input string
def sort_frequency: sort the frequencies in a list of tuples
def buildTree: build a tree with sorted tuples in 
def trimTree: filter the frequencies in the tree
def assignCodes: assign binary codes for the chars
def encode: encode the text string. We use the helper functions above to generate a code dictionry and encode.
def decode: decode the binary string. Based on the bit code in the string, we traverse the tree until we reach the leaf nodes.

Time Complexity: 
For encoding, worst case may be O(n*2) since the the frequency method uses a dict get method in a for loop.
For decoding , worst case will be O(n)



Active Dirs:
We use recursion to get all the users in a group and their sub-groups. A better approach may be using binary search tree which is not yet covered in this module.
Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m is the number of users and n is the number of groups

Blockchain:
We use a list to hold all the blocks which are interlinked similar to linked lists.
We create genesis block as the first block to start with. We add a block using the last element(block) in the list 
Time Complexity: 
Worst Case to display blockchain function is O(n).
Wrost case to create and add a block is O(1).


Union and intersection of 2 linked lists:
Both union and intersection operations require not to have duplicates in them.
We use dictionary as a lookup to remove deuplicates.
Union operation just assigns the head of one linked list to the tail of another linked list. Then, we remove duplicates from the linked list.
Intersection operation uses a dictionary as a lookup for one linked list and the traverse through another linked list to get the common elements and then remove the duplicates.
Time Complexity:
Due to the precense of a dictionary lookup in a while loop, bot the union and intersection have a worst case analysis of O(n*2) where n is the number of elements in the list.
